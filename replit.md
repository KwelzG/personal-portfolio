- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for branding
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui component library with Radix UI primitives
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth page transitions and interactive elements
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state, React hooks for local state
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js server
- **Language**: TypeScript throughout the stack
- **Development**: Hot module replacement via Vite middleware integration
- **API Structure**: RESTful API endpoints with `/api` prefix routing

### Component Structure
The application follows a component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Layout Components**: Navigation, Footer
- **Section Components**: Hero, About, Projects, Timeline, Contact, etc.
- **UI Components**: Reusable Shadcn/ui components
- **Utility Functions**: Shared helpers and configurations

## Key Components

### Core Sections
1. **Hero Section**: Bold introduction with animated elements and call-to-action
2. **Journey Timeline**: Interactive timeline showing personal milestones and growth
3. **About Section**: Multi-tab interface showcasing different facets of personality
4. **Projects Section**: Showcase of Prop3 and LexAI with status indicators
5. **Digital Vault**: Collection of digital products and tools
6. **Live Feed**: Real-time updates and current learning focus
7. **Contact Section**: Multi-purpose contact form with social links

### Design System
- **Color Palette**: Black/gold/silver theme with custom CSS variables
- **Typography**: Modern, bold typography emphasizing impact
- **Animations**: Scroll-triggered animations, hover effects, and smooth transitions
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoint-specific layouts

### Interactive Features
- Smooth scrolling navigation
- Animated timeline milestones
- Tab-based content organization
- Form handling with toast notifications
- Mobile-responsive navigation menu

## Data Flow

### Client-Side Data Flow
1. **Component Rendering**: React components render based on props and local state
2. **User Interactions**: Events trigger state updates and navigation changes
3. **Animation Triggers**: Framer Motion responds to scroll position and user interactions
4. **Form Submissions**: Contact forms collect data and provide user feedback

### State Management
- **Local State**: React useState for component-specific data
- **Global State**: Minimal global state, primarily handled through context
- **Server State**: TanStack Query for any future API integration
- **UI State**: Form states, modal visibility, navigation state

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **React Ecosystem**: React 18, React DOM, React Router alternative (Wouter)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, PostCSS, Autoprefixer
- **UI Framework**: Radix UI primitives, Shadcn/ui components
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Utilities**: clsx, class-variance-authority, date-fns

### Development Dependencies
- **Build Tools**: Vite, TypeScript, ESBuild
- **Database**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL (configured but not actively used)
- **Development**: TSX for development server, various type definitions

### Database Infrastructure
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM configured for PostgreSQL
- **Migrations**: Database migration system in place
- **Schema**: User schema defined but minimal usage in current implementation
- **Storage**: Memory storage implementation as fallback

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
1. **Frontend Build**: Vite builds optimized React application
2. **Backend Build**: ESBuild bundles Express server for production
3. **Asset Optimization**: Vite handles CSS/JS bundling and asset optimization
4. **TypeScript Compilation**: Full type checking during build process

### Production Configuration
- **Server**: Express.js server serves static files and API routes
- **Environment**: NODE_ENV-based configuration
- **Database**: PostgreSQL connection via environment variables
- **Static Assets**: Served from dist/public directory

### Development Workflow
- **Hot Reload**: Vite middleware provides instant feedback
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript ensures type safety across the stack
- **Error Handling**: Custom error boundaries and development error overlays
- **Replit Integration**: Special handling for Replit development environment

### Scalability Considerations
- **Component Modularity**: Easy to extend with new sections
- **API Ready**: Backend structure prepared for future API endpoints
- **Database Ready**: Full ORM setup for when dynamic content is needed
- **Performance**: Optimized animations and lazy loading considerations

The application is designed as a high-impact personal portfolio that can evolve from a static showcase into a dynamic platform as the user's ventures grow and require more interactive features.
