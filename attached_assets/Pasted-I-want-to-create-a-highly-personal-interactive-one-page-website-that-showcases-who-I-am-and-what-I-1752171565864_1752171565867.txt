I want to create a highly-personal, interactive, one-page website that showcases who I am and what I do. My name is Gracious Justin Kwelle, and I'm a young polymath founder, builder, and digital hustler based in Nigeria. I’m building two companies:

Prop3 — an AI x Web3 platform for real-world asset tokenization (starting with real estate in Africa)

LexAI Solutions — an AI-powered legal support service for African law firms.

My website should reflect my raw, authentic journey — mixing street hustle, digital innovation, faith, and African excellence. It should feel like the online home of a future billionaire.

📌 Website Structure:
1. Hero Section (Intro)

Big bold headline: “Gracious Justin Kwelle”

Subtext: “Faith. Wealth. Hustle. Growth. Documented.”

Background: Slight movement or glossy black aesthetic with gold or silver elements

Optional: A short looping video or raw image of me working, building, or in the streets

2. About Me Section (With Motion)

Write it in first person. I’m 19. Tell my story — barbing apprentice + startup builder + trader + content docu-journalist. Mention I’m building billion-dollar platforms, not just startups.

Include a fun fact block: “Current challenge: Building 10 hustles in 100 days.”

3. Projects Section (Prop3 + LexAI)

Each project gets a card: logo, short summary, status (e.g., MVP, Clients Active, etc.)

Clicking the card gives a deeper pop-up or scroll-reveal (like a portfolio showcase)

4. Digital Products/Experiments Section

List my trading journal, digital product drops, or AI tools I’m building

Include “Coming Soon” tags for unfinished ones

5. Content Hub / Media Section

Embed my IG or X (Twitter) feed

Have a “featured threads or posts” carousel

6. Contact / Work With Me Section

Minimal but clean form

Add CTAs like “Partner with me”, “Hire me to write for your Web3 startup”, or “Pitch me an idea”

7. Footer

A sleek footer with quotes like:
“Built from the dirt. Scaling to the clouds.”
“Everything documented. Nothing wasted.”

Include basic links: IG, Twitter, Email

🎨 Design Vibe:
Dark glossy background (black/gold/silver)

Urban but elite: clean fonts, minimal layout, subtle animations

Icons that feel futuristic but grounded in Africa

Mobile-optimized and fast loading

⚙️ Tech Features (Optional but nice to have):
Sticky navbar

Scroll-based animation or parallax

Interactive timeline for my 100-day challenge

AI chatbot widget trained on my story

Blog or writing page that syncs from Notion or MD files

Option to switch between “Builder Mode” and “Documentarian Mode”
