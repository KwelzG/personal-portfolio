I want you to build a polymathic personal website — one that doesn't just show what I’ve built, but tracks who I’m becoming.

My name is Gracious Justin Kwelle, a 19-year-old African polymath-in-progress. I’m a:

Startup founder (Prop3 + LexAI)

Trader

Content documentarian

Barbing apprentice

Web3 innovator

Future father of twins

This site should feel like an epic yet grounded journey — like a digital scroll of a man mastering multiple crafts on his way to a billion-dollar impact.

✨ Site Structure (Sections)
1. Hero Section (Opening Scene)

Name: Gracious Justin Kwelle

Tagline: “Builder of Realities. Documenter of Becoming.”

CTA Button: “Start My Journey”

2. Journey Path (Polymath Tracker)

A horizontal or vertical timeline with milestones like:

Age 13: Started thinking deeply

Age 16: Touched Web3

Age 18: First barbing client

Make it interactive: hover or click = short story or media snippet

Optional: Add “Current Level: Hustler Tier 4” like a game tracker

3. Who I Am (Layered Bio)

Split into 3 tabs/cards:

Now (what I’m doing this season)

Becoming (what I’m building into)

Core (values: faith, grit, documentation, legacy)

Include a rotating quote or voice snippet

4. My Hustles (Projects + Skills)

Prop3 and LexAI featured as core ventures

Add other hustle lanes: Trading, Barbing, Content

Each with status (Learning | Earning | Scaling) and “Journal Logs” (click = story behind it)
